Devious Methods

A terrorist mole has leaked the location of a secret US-owned industrial facility within enemy territory.  They have infiltrated a warehouse containing US missile parts.  


Terrorists:
Destroy either the stored parts at bomb target B, or disable the loading elevator at site A.  This will buy you additional time for missions elsewhere.

Counter-Terrorists:

Preserve the stored parts at bombsite B, and protect the elevator at bombsite A.  Use of deadly force is authorized.
